# Explanation

**Smart Contract Explanation: AayushToken**

This Solidity smart contract defines a simple token contract named `AayushToken`. It allows users to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens. Let's break down the code with bullet points and headings:

1. **SPDX License Identifier**:
   - The contract starts with an SPDX-License-Identifier comment, indicating that the code is licensed under the MIT License.

2. **Solidity Version Pragma**:
   - `pragma solidity 0.8.18;`: This specifies the Solidity compiler version to be used. The contract is written in version 0.8.18 of Solidity.

3. **Contract Declaration**:
   - `contract AayushToken { ... }`: Defines the main contract named `AayushToken`.

4. **Public State Variables**:
   - `string public tokenName = "AayushToken";`: Declares a public string variable storing the token's name.
   - `string public tokenSymbol = "21BCG1065";`: Declares a public string variable storing the token's symbol.
   - `uint public totalSupply = 0;`: Declares a public uint (unsigned integer) variable to store the total token supply.

5. **Mapping for Balances**:
   - `mapping(address => uint) public balances;`: Defines a mapping named `balances` that associates addresses with their token balances. The balances are stored as unsigned integers.

6. **Mint Function**:
   - `function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public { ... }`: This function allows tokens to be minted (created) and assigned to a given address.
     - `address _address`: The address to which tokens will be minted.
     - `uint _amount`: The amount of tokens to mint and assign.
     - It increases the `totalSupply` by `_amount` and updates the balance of `_address` accordingly.

7. **Burn Function**:
   - `function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public { ... }`: This function allows tokens to be burned (destroyed) for a specific address.
     - `address _address`: The address from which tokens will be burned.
     - `uint _amount`: The amount of tokens to burn.
     - It checks if the balance of `_address` is sufficient to burn `_amount` tokens, and if so, decreases the `totalSupply` and the balance of `_address`.
      
# Code

//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;


contract AayushToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "AayushToken";
    string public tokenSymbol = "21BCG1065";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        totalSupply += _amount;
        balances[_address] += _amount;
    }

    // burn function
    function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public {
        require(balances[_address] >= _amount, "Cannot burn more than balance tokens");
        totalSupply -= _amount;
        balances[_address] -= _amount;
    }
}

# Execution

1. **Environment Selection**:
   - Open the [Remix Solidity IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Make sure you are on a compatible Solidity version. In Remix, you can select the compiler version from the "Solidity Compiler" tab on the left sidebar.

2. **Deployment**:
   - Copy and paste the provided code into the Remix editor.

3. **Compile**:
   - Click the "Compile" button on the Remix interface to compile the smart contract. Ensure that the code compiles without errors.

4. **Deploy Contract**:
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab on the left sidebar.
   - Select "AayushToken" from the contract dropdown (it should appear after compiling).
   - Click the "Deploy" button next to the contract dropdown.
   - Confirm the transaction in the MetaMask pop-up if you are using the Ethereum Mainnet or a testnet.

5. **Interact with the Contract**:
   - After deploying, the deployed contract instance will be displayed below.
   - Expand the contract instance to see the available functions.

6. **Mint Tokens**:
   - In the contract instance section, find the "mintTokens" function.
   - Enter the address `_address` where you want to mint tokens and the `_amount` of tokens to mint.
   - Click the "transact" button to mint tokens to the specified address.

7. **Burn Tokens**:
   - In the contract instance section, find the "burnTokens" function.
   - Enter the address `_address` from which you want to burn tokens and the `_amount` of tokens to burn.
   - Click the "transact" button to burn tokens from the specified address.

8. **View Token Balances**:
   - You can view the balances of different addresses using the `balances` mapping, which is automatically generated as a public getter function.
   - Enter an address in the "balances" section of the contract instance and click the "transact" button to view the balance.
