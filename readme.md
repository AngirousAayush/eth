# Explanation
**Smart Contract Explanation: AayushToken**

This Solidity smart contract defines a simple token contract named `AayushToken`. It allows users to mint (create) and burn (destroy) tokens. Let's break down the code with bullet points and headings:

1. **SPDX License Identifier**:
   - The contract starts with an SPDX-License-Identifier comment, indicating that the code is licensed under the MIT License.

2. **Solidity Version Pragma**:
   - `pragma solidity 0.8.18;`: This specifies the Solidity compiler version to be used. The contract is written in version 0.8.18 of Solidity.

3. **Contract Declaration**:
   - `contract AayushToken { ... }`: Defines the main contract named `AayushToken`.

4. **Public State Variables**:
   - `string public tokenName = "AayushToken";`: Declares a public string variable storing the token's name.
   - `string public tokenSymbol = "21BCG1065";`: Declares a public string variable storing the token's symbol.
   - `uint public totalSupply = 0;`: Declares a public uint (unsigned integer) variable to store the total token supply.

5. **Mapping for Balances**:
   - `mapping(address => uint) public balances;`: Defines a mapping named `balances` that associates addresses with their token balances. The balances are stored as unsigned integers.

6. **Mint Function**:
   - `function mintTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public { ... }`: This function allows tokens to be minted (created) and assigned to a given address.
     - `address _address`: The address to which tokens will be minted.
     - `uint _amount`: The amount of tokens to mint and assign.
     - It increases the `totalSupply` by `_amount` and updates the balance of `_address` accordingly.

7. **Burn Function**:
   - `function burnTokens(address _address, uint _amount) public { ... }`: This function allows tokens to be burned (destroyed) for a specific address.
     - `address _address`: The address from which tokens will be burned.
     - `uint _amount`: The amount of tokens to burn.
     - It checks if the balance of `_address` is sufficient to burn `_amount` tokens, and if so, decreases the `totalSupply` and the balance of `_address`.
